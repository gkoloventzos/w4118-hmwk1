Assumptions
I am not handling the ./ commands as the user can just put the working directory
in the path.

I can handle up to 128 arguments per command (line 42).

My parser is from a previous exercise and someone told told that is from either
Kernighan or Richie from a book. I have searched the K&R book but it is not there.

I also used some of the man pages of exec, pipe, malloc, fork, wait, strtok, strdup,
free and the rest of the gang.

Some wikipedia and always the stackoverflow for some pipe ideas.
